    <h5>What is Mutual Fund:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>A mutual fund is an investment option where money from many people is pooled together to buy a variety of stocks, bonds, or other securities. This mix of investments is managed by a professional money manager, providing individuals with a portfolio that is structured to match the investment objectives stated in the fund's prospectus.</li>
    <li>By investing in a mutual fund, individuals gain access to a broad range of investments, which can help reduce risk compared to investing in a single stock or bond. Investors earn returns based on the fund's performance minus any fees or expenses charged. In this way, mutual funds can give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other asset classes.</li>
</ul>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
<h5>Types of Mutual Funds:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Stock Funds: As the name implies, this fund invests principally in equity or stocks. Within this group are various subcategories. Some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in: small-, mid-, or large-cap. Others are named by their investment approach: aggressive growth, income-oriented, value, and others. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they invest in domestic (U.S.) stocks or foreign equities. To understand the universe of equity funds is to use a style box, an example of which is below.</li>
    <li>Bond Funds: A mutual fund that generates a minimum return is part of the fixed income category. A fixed-income mutual fund focuses on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or other debt instruments. The fund portfolio generates interest income that is passed on to the shareholders.</li>
    <li>Index Funds: Index funds invest in stocks that correspond with a major market index such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). This strategy requires less research from analysts and advisors, so fewer expenses are passed on to shareholders, and these funds are often designed with cost-sensitive investors in mind.</li>
    <li>Balanced Funds: Balanced funds invest in a hybrid of asset classes, whether stocks, bonds, money market instruments, or alternative investments. The objective of this fund, known as an asset allocation fund, is to reduce the risk of exposure across asset classes.</li>
    <li>Money Market Funds: The money market consists of safe, risk-free, short-term debt instruments, mostly government Treasury bills. An investor will not earn substantial returns, but the principal is guaranteed. A typical return is a little more than the amount earned in a regular checking or savings account and a little less than the average certificate of deposit (CD).</li>
    <li>Income Funds: Income funds are named for their purpose: to provide current income on a steady basis. These funds invest primarily in government and high-quality corporate debt, holding these bonds until maturity to provide interest streams. While fund holdings may appreciate, the primary objective of these funds is to provide steady cash flow to investors. As such, the audience for these funds consists of conservative investors and retirees.</li>
    <li>International/Global Funds: An international fund, or foreign fund, invests only in assets located outside an investor's home country. Global funds, however, can invest anywhere around the world. Their volatility often depends on the unique country's economy and political risks. However, these funds can be part of a well-balanced portfolio by increasing diversification, since the returns in foreign countries may be uncorrelated with returns at home.</li>
    <li>Specialty Funds: Sector funds are targeted strategy funds aimed at specific sectors of the economy, such as financial, technology, or healthcare. Sector funds can be extremely volatile since the stocks in a given sector tend to be highly correlated with each other. Regional funds make it easier to focus on a specific geographic area of the world. This can mean focusing on a broader region or an individual country. Socially responsible funds, or ethical funds, invest only in companies that meet the criteria of certain guidelines or beliefs. For example, some socially responsible funds do not invest in "sin" industries such as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, weapons, or nuclear power. Other funds invest primarily in green technology, such as solar and wind power or recycling.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h5>Why we need mutual funds:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Professional Management — Investors may not have the time or the required knowledge and resources to conduct their research and purchase individual stocks or bonds. A mutual fund is managed by full-time, professional money managers who have the expertise, experience and resources to actively buy, sell, and monitor investments. A fund manager continuously monitors investments and rebalances the portfolio accordingly to meet the scheme’s objectives. Portfolio management by professional fund managers is one of the most important advantages of a mutual fund.</li>
    <li>Risk Diversification — Buying shares in a mutual fund is an easy way to diversify your investments across many securities and asset categories such as equity, debt and gold, which helps in spreading the risk - so you won't have all your eggs in one basket. This proves to be beneficial when an underlying security of a given mutual fund scheme experiences market headwinds. With diversification, the risk associated with one asset class is countered by the others. Even if one investment in the portfolio decreases in value, other investments may not be impacted and may even increase in value. In other words, you don’t lose out on the entire value of your investment if a particular component of your portfolio goes through a turbulent period. Thus, risk diversification is one of the most prominent advantages of investing in mutual funds.</li>
    <li>Affordability & Convenience (Invest Small Amounts) — For many investors, it could be more costly to directly purchase all of the individual securities held by a single mutual fund. By contrast, the minimum initial investments for most mutual funds are more affordable.</li>
    <li>Liquidity — You can easily redeem (liquidate) units of open ended mutual fund schemes to meet your financial needs on any business day (when the stock markets and/or banks are open), so you have easy access to your money. Upon redemption, the redemption amount is credited in your bank account within one day to 3-4 days, depending upon the type of scheme e.g., in respect of Liquid Funds and Overnight Funds, the redemption amount is paid out the next business day. However, please note that units of close-ended mutual fund schemes can be redeemed only on maturity. Likewise, units of ELSS have a 3-year lock-in period and can be liquidated only thereafter.</li>
    <li>Low Cost — An important advantage of mutual funds is their low cost. Due to huge economies of scale, mutual funds schemes have a low expense ratio. Expense ratio represents the annual fund operating expenses of a scheme, expressed as a percentage of the fund’s daily net assets. Operating expenses of a scheme are administration, management, advertising related expenses, etc. The limits of expense ratio for various types of schemes has been specified under Regulation 52 of SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations, 1996.</li>
    <li>Well-Regulated — Mutual Funds are regulated by the capital markets regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. SEBI has laid down stringent rules and regulations keeping investor protection, transparency with appropriate risk mitigation framework and fair valuation principles.</li>
    <li>Tax Benefits — Investment in ELSS upto ₹1,50,000 qualifies for tax benefit under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Mutual Fund investments when held for a longer term are tax efficient</li>
</ul>

<h5>What is a Mutual Fund Portfolio?</h5>
<p>Each one of us works hard to earn money and provide for our families. We also cut corners and try to save some funds for the proverbial rainy days. However, with inflation eating away at our savings, investments are the only way to ensure that our savings don't devalue with time. Choosing an investment option in one of the most important financial decisions that we make in our lives. Real estate, stocks, gold, mutual funds, fixed deposit; the options are virtually endless and the result - confusion. Even if an investor decides to invest in Mutual Funds, there is a plethora of funds to choose from which doesn't make it any easier. A Mutual fund portfolio helps make some sense out of this cacophony.</p>
<p>Mutual Fund Portfolio is the collection of investments made in different MF schemes. All these investments are in sync with your investment goals and objectives. offers a comprehensive view of your investments in Mutual funds and allows you to monitor them or analyze and manage them better.</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h5>Based on Asset Class</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Equity Funds:</strong> Equity funds primarily invest in stocks, and hence go by the name of stock funds as well. They invest the money pooled in from various investors from diverse backgrounds into shares/stocks of different companies. The gains and losses associated with these funds depend solely on how the invested shares perform (price-hikes or price-drops) in the stock market. Also, equity funds have the potential to generate significant returns over a period. Hence, the risk associated with these funds also tends to be comparatively higher.</li>
    <li><strong>Debt Funds:</strong> Debt funds invest primarily in fixed-income securities such as bonds, securities and treasury bills. They invest in various fixed income instruments such as Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs), Gilt Funds, Liquid Funds, Short-Term Plans, Long-Term Bonds and Monthly Income Plans, among others. Since the investments come with a fixed interest rate and maturity date, it can be a great option for passive investors looking for regular income (interest and capital appreciation) with minimal risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Money Market Funds:</strong> Investors trade stocks in the stock market. In the same way, investors also invest in the money market, also known as capital market or cash market. The government runs it in association with banks, financial institutions and other corporations by issuing money market securities like bonds, T-bills, dated securities and certificates of deposits, among others. The fund manager invests your money and disburses regular dividends in return. Opting for a short-term plan (not more than 13 months) can lower the risk of investment considerably on such funds.</li>
    <li><strong>Hybrid Funds:</strong> As the name suggests, hybrid funds (Balanced Funds) is an optimum mix of bonds and stocks, thereby bridging the gap between equity funds and debt funds. The ratio can either be variable or fixed. In short, it takes the best of two mutual funds by distributing, say, 60% of assets in stocks and the rest in bonds or vice versa. Hybrid funds are suitable for investors looking to take more risks for ‘debt plus returns’ benefit rather than sticking to lower but steady income schemes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="container">
    <h5>Based on Investment Goals</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Growth Funds:</strong> Growth funds usually allocate a considerable portion in shares and growth sectors, suitable for investors (mostly Millennials) who have a surplus of idle money to be distributed in riskier plans (albeit with possibly high returns) or are positive about the scheme.</li>
    <li><strong>Income Funds:</strong> Income funds belong to the family of debt mutual funds that distribute their money in a mix of bonds, certificate of deposits and securities among others. Helmed by skilled fund managers who keep the portfolio in tandem with the rate fluctuations without compromising on the portfolio’s creditworthiness, income funds have historically earned investors better returns than deposits. They are best suited for risk-averse investors with a 2-3 years perspective.</li>
    <li><strong>Liquid Funds:</strong> Like income funds, liquid funds also belong to the debt fund category as they invest in debt instruments and money market with a tenure of up to 91 days. The maximum sum allowed to invest is Rs 10 lakh. A highlighting feature that differentiates liquid funds from other debt funds is the way the Net Asset Value is calculated. The NAV of liquid funds is calculated for 365 days (including Sundays) while for others, only business days are considered.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax-Saving Funds:</strong> ELSS or Equity Linked Saving Scheme, over the years, have climbed up the ranks among all categories of investors. Not only do they offer the benefit of wealth maximisation while allowing you to save on taxes, but they also come with the lowest lock-in period of only three years. Investing predominantly in equity (and related products), they are known to generate non-taxed returns in the range 14-16%. These funds are best-suited for salaried investors with a long-term investment horizon.</li>
    <li><strong>Aggressive Growth Funds:</strong> Slightly on the riskier side when choosing where to invest in, the Aggressive Growth Fund is designed to make steep monetary gains. Though susceptible to market volatility, one can decide on the fund as per the beta (the tool to gauge the fund’s movement in comparison with the market). Example, if the market shows a beta of 1, an aggressive growth fund will reflect a higher beta, say, 1.10 or above.</li>
    <li><strong>Capital Protection Funds:</strong> If protecting the principal is the priority, Capital Protection Funds serves the purpose while earning relatively smaller returns (12% at best). The fund manager invests a portion of the money in bonds or Certificates of Deposits and the rest towards equities. Though the probability of incurring any loss is quite low, it is advised to stay invested for at least three years (closed-ended) to safeguard your money, and also the returns are taxable.</li>
    <li><strong>Fixed Maturity Funds:</strong> Many investors choose to invest towards the of the FY ends to take advantage of triple indexation, thereby bringing down tax burden. If uncomfortable with the debt market trends and related risks, Fixed Maturity Plans (FMP) – which invest in bonds, securities, money market etc. – present a great opportunity. As a close-ended plan, FMP functions on a fixed maturity period, which could range from one month to five years (like FDs). The fund manager ensures that the money is allocated to an investment with the same tenure, to reap accrual interest at the time of FMP maturity.</li>
    <li><strong>Pension Funds:</strong> Putting away a portion of your income in a chosen pension fund to accrue over a long period to secure you and your family’s financial future after retiring from regular employment can take care of most contingencies (like a medical emergency or children’s wedding). Relying solely on savings to get through your golden years is not recommended as savings (no matter how big) get used up. EPF is an example, but there are many lucrative schemes offered by banks, insurance firms etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h5>Based on Structure</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Open-Ended Funds:</strong> Open-ended funds do not have any particular constraint such as a specific period or the number of units which can be traded. These funds allow investors to trade funds at their convenience and exit when required at the prevailing NAV (Net Asset Value). This is the sole reason why the unit capital continually changes with new entries and exits. An open-ended fund can also decide to stop taking in new investors if they do not want to (or cannot manage significant funds).</li>
    <li><strong>Closed-Ended Funds:</strong> In closed-ended funds, the unit capital to invest is pre-defined. Meaning the fund company cannot sell more than the pre-agreed number of units. Some funds also come with a New Fund Offer (NFO) period; wherein there is a deadline to buy units. NFOs comes with a pre-defined maturity tenure with fund managers open to any fund size. Hence, SEBI has mandated that investors be given the option to either repurchase option or list the funds on stock exchanges to exit the schemes.</li>
    <li><strong>Interval Funds:</strong> Interval funds have traits of both open-ended and closed-ended funds. These funds are open for purchase or redemption only during specific intervals (decided by the fund house) and closed the rest of the time. Also, no transactions will be permitted for at least two years. These funds are suitable for investors looking to save a lump sum amount for a short-term financial goal, say, in 3-12 months.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h5>Based on Risk</h5>
<p>The mutual fund types based on risk are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Very Low-Risk Funds:</strong> Liquid funds and ultra-short-term funds (one month to one year) are known for its low risk, and understandably their returns are also low (6% at best). Investors choose this to fulfil their short-term financial goals and to keep their money safe through these funds.</li>
    <li><strong>Low-Risk Funds:</strong> In the event of rupee depreciation or unexpected national crisis, investors are unsure about investing in riskier funds. In such cases, fund managers recommend putting money in either one or a combination of liquid, ultra short-term or arbitrage funds. Returns could be 6-8%, but the investors are free to switch when valuations become more stable.</li>
    <li><strong>Medium-risk Funds:</strong> Here, the risk factor is of medium level as the fund manager invests a portion in debt and the rest in equity funds. The NAV is not that volatile, and the average returns could be 9-12%.</li>
    <li><strong>High-Risk Funds:</strong> Suitable for investors with no risk aversion and aiming for huge returns in the form of interest and dividends, high-risk mutual funds need active fund management. Regular performance reviews are mandatory as they are susceptible to market volatility. You can expect 15% returns, though most high-risk funds generally provide up to 20% returns.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h5>Specialized Mutual Funds</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sector Funds:</strong> Sector funds invest solely in one specific sector, theme-based mutual funds. As these funds invest only in specific sectors with only a few stocks, the risk factor is on the higher side. Investors are advised to keep track of the various sector-related trends. Sector funds also deliver great returns. Some areas of banking, IT and pharma have witnessed huge and consistent growth in the recent past and are predicted to be promising in future as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Index Funds:</strong> Suited best for passive investors, index funds put money in an index. A fund manager does not manage it. An index fund identifies stocks and their corresponding ratio in the market index and put the money in similar proportion in similar stocks. Even if they cannot outdo the market (which is the reason why they are not popular in India), they play it safe by mimicking the index performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Funds of Funds:</strong> A diversified mutual fund investment portfolio offers a slew of benefits, and ‘Funds of Funds’ also known as multi-manager mutual funds are made to exploit this to the tilt – by putting their money in diverse fund categories. In short, buying one fund that invests in many funds rather than investing in several achieves diversification while keeping the cost down at the same time.</li>
    <li><strong>Emerging market Funds:</strong> To invest in developing markets is considered a risky bet, and it has undergone negative returns too. India, in itself, is a dynamic and emerging market where investors earn high returns from the domestic stock market. Like all markets, they are also prone to market fluctuations. Also, from a longer-term perspective, emerging economies are expected to contribute to the majority of global growth in the following decades.</li>
    <li><strong>International/ Foreign Funds:</strong> Favoured by investors looking to spread their investment to other countries, foreign mutual funds can get investors good returns even when the Indian Stock Markets perform well. An investor can employ a hybrid approach (say, 60% in domestic equities and the rest in overseas funds) or a feeder approach (getting local funds to place them in foreign stocks) or a theme-based allocation (e.g., gold mining).</li>
    <li><strong>Global Funds:</strong> Aside from the same lexical meaning, global funds are quite different from International Funds. While a global fund chiefly invests in markets worldwide, it also includes investment in your home country. The International Funds concentrate solely on foreign markets. Diverse and universal in approach, global funds can be quite risky to owing to different policies, market and currency variations, though it does work as a break against inflation and long-term returns have been historically high.</li>
    <li><strong>Real Estate Funds:</strong> Despite the real estate boom in India, many investors are still hesitant to invest in such projects due to its multiple risks. Real estate fund can be a perfect alternative as the investor will be an indirect participant by putting their money in established real estate companies/trusts rather than projects. A long-term investment negates risks and legal hassles when it comes to purchasing a property as well as provide liquidity to some extent.</li>
    <li><strong>Commodity-focused Stock Funds:</strong> These funds are ideal for investors with sufficient risk-appetite and looking to diversify their portfolio. Commodity-focused stock funds give a chance to dabble in multiple and diverse trades. Returns, however, may not be periodic and are either based on the performance of the stock company or the commodity itself. Gold is the only commodity in which mutual funds can invest directly in India. The rest purchase fund units or shares from commodity businesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Neutral Funds:</strong> For investors seeking protection from unfavourable market tendencies while sustaining good returns, market-neutral funds meet the purpose (like a hedge fund). With better risk-adaptability, these funds give high returns where even small investors can outstrip the market without stretching the portfolio limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Inverse/Leveraged Funds:</strong> While a regular index fund moves in tandem with the benchmark index, the returns of an inverse index fund shift in the opposite direction. It is nothing but selling your shares when the stock goes down, only to repurchase them at an even lesser cost (to hold until the price goes up again).</li>
    <li><strong>Asset Allocation Funds:</strong> Combining debt, equity and even gold in an optimum ratio, this is a greatly flexible fund. Based on a pre-set formula or fund manager’s inferences based on the current market trends, asset allocation funds can regulate the equity-debt distribution. It is almost like hybrid funds but requires great expertise in choosing and allocation of the bonds and stocks from the fund manager.</li>
    <li><strong>Gift Funds:</strong> Yes, you can also gift a mutual fund or a SIP to your loved ones to secure their financial future.</li>
    <li><strong>Exchange-traded Funds:</strong> It belongs to the index funds family and is bought and sold on exchanges. Exchange-traded Funds have unlocked a new world of investment prospects, enabling investors to gain extensive exposure to stock markets abroad as well as specialised sectors. An ETF is like a mutual fund that can be traded in real-time at a price that may rise or fall many times in a day.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a tax-paying citizen, Section-80C of the Indian Tax Act allows you some breather – a deduction of up to 150,000 from your total annual income.</p>
